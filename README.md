## Hi there 👋

I specialize in designing funding mechanisms, building data tools, modeling public goods dynamics, and architecting crypto-native solutions to coordination problems.

I am currently working on:
- 📊 Grant Analytics — Designing metrics and visualizations for cohort performance
- 🧮 Retroactive Grants — Building better funding signals from developer activity
- 🔍 AI x Climate Funding — Multi-agent assistants for measurable bounty design
- 🪴 Capital Rails for Climate Action — Verifiable financial plumbing for grassroots climate work
